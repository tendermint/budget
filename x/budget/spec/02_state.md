## Budget

Budget object is not stored in KVStore. 

```go
// Budget contains budget information
type Budget struct {
	Name                string    // name of the budget 
	Rate                sdk.Dec   // distributing amount by ratio of total budget source
	BudgetSourceAddress string    // bech32-encoded address that source of the budget
	CollectionAddress   string    // bech32-encoded address that collects budget from the budget source address
	StartTime           time.Time // start time of the budget plan
	EndTime             time.Time // end time of the budget plan
}
```
There does not require any interaction from the BudgetSourceAddress to accept that money will be withdrawn.
If this address is for e.g. is dormant, participants of the blockchain can vote to transfer his money and be
used by the community. Is this intentional?

For the purpose of tracking total collected coins for a budget, budget name is used as key to find it in store.
