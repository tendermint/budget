# Concepts

## Budget Module

`x/budget` is a simple Cosmos SDK module that implements budget functionality. It is an independent module (not sure about this because it uses the bank and auth modules for instance) from other SDK modules and core functionality is to enable anyone to create a budget plan through parameter change governance proposal. Once it is agreed within the community, voted, and passed, it uses `BudgetSourceAddress` to distribute amount of coins relative to the rate defined in the plan to the `CollectionAddress`. At each `BeginBlock`, collecting all budgets and distribution take place every `EpochBlocks`. `EpochBlocks` is a global parameter that can be modified by a governance proposal.

A primary use case is for Gravity DEX farming plan. The budget module can be used to create a budget plan that has `BudgetSourceAddress` for Cosmos Hub's [FeeCollector](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.44.0/x/auth/types/keys.go#L15) module account which collects transaction gas fees and part of ATOM inflation. Then, `BudgetSourceAddress` plans to distribute some amount of coins to `CollectionAddress` for farming plan. 

### Budget Plan for ATOM Inflation Use Case

Cosmos SDK's current reward workflow

- In AnteHandler

    - Gas fees are collected in ante handler and they are sent to `FeeCollectorName` module account

    - Reference the following lines of code

      +++ https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.44.0/x/auth/ante/fee.go#L112-L140

- In `x/mint` module

  - ATOM inflation is minted in `x/mint` module and they are sent to `FeeCollectorName` module account

  - Reference the following lines of code

    +++ https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.44.0/x/mint/abci.go#L27-L40

    +++ https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.44.0/x/mint/keeper/keeper.go#L108-L110

- In `x/distribution` module

  - Send all rewards in `FeeCollectorName` to distribution module account
  
  - From `distributionModuleAccount`, substitute `communityTax`

  - Rest are distributed to proposer and validator reward pools

  - Substituted amount for community budget is saved in kv store

  - Reference the following lines of code

    +++ https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.44.0/x/distribution/keeper/allocation.go#L13-L102

Implementation with Budget Module

  - The budget module is 100% independent from other Cosmos SDK's existing modules

  - BeginBlock processing order is the following order

      - mint module → budget module → distribution module

  - Distribute ATOM inflation and transaction gas fees to different budget purposes

    - ATOM inflation and gas fees are accumulated in `FeeCollectorName` module account

    - Distribute budget amounts from `FeeCollectorName` module account to each budget pool module account

    - Rest amounts stay in `FeeCollectorName` so that distribution module can use it for community fund and staking rewards distribution as what it is doing now

  - Create, modify or remove budget plans via governance process
    - A budget plan can be created, modified or removed by parameter change governance proposal
